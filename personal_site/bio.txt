As a Computer Science undergraduate, Robert Vaughan strives to become a well-respected figure in his field of study and hopes to accomplish many feats within his career.

In 2015, Robert enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (Hons) Computer Science course in Technological University Dublin (formerly known as Dublin Institute of Technology). Whilst in his studies, Robert along with his peers founded the Computer Science society within the institute which he chaired for a two-year period. When his course concluded, Robert was a First-Class Honours with an 80% overall average score and 82% in his final dissertation. His dissertation project was also awarded the "Most Innovative Software Engineering Project" award at the university's annual Project Fair.

Robert took his first developer role the Summer of 2017 when earning a Software Developer role at the award winning Irish digital media company ZOO. It was here that he gained his first tastes in the challenges and responsibilities that a developer can face on full-stack projects and became fully committed to the idea of becoming a well-respected figure within the field of software development and engineering. In 2018, Robert received an internship opportunity with the HCM software company Workday to which he could fully demonstrate and improve his existing skillsets over a six month plus period within a large-scale technically stack. 

To date, Robert is a Software Application Engineer I at Workday. During his free time, Robert usually takes an interest in developing mobile applications and focusing on projects in the realm of Blockchain.
