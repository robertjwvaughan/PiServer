# Robert Vaughan Personal Site

The aim of this site is to create a representation of me (Robert) through a website in terms of its presentation and how its built.

Years ago I built a site, which you may find in the commit trail of this repo, that I built for a bit of fun during a lunch break. When going back and viewing it, I realised components of it did not relate to me in the slightest. I hope that this piece of work will give an quick and simple indication of the developer and person I set out to be.
